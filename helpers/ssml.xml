The meaning of life is to find your own happiness and share it with others. It is to explore the world and yourself, to learn and grow, to love and be loved, to create and contribute, to enjoy and appreciate. It is to make the most of your time and talents, and to leave a positive legacy. (100 words)</mstts:express-as>
